VIDEO RECORDING GUIDE - ROULETTE PREDICTION SYSTEM

PREPARATION:
1. Make sure all demo scripts are ready: animate_roulette.py, demo_window.py, and demo_minimal.py
2. Have the voiceover script open and ready to read
3. Check that your microphone is working properly
4. Arrange for a quiet recording environment
5. Make sure you have screen recording software ready (e.g., OBS, Camtasia, or even Windows Game Bar)

RECORDING SEQUENCE:

1. INTRO SLIDE (15-20 seconds)
   - Create a simple title slide showing "Roulette Prediction System using Reinforcement Learning"
   - Include your name/institution if needed
   - Read the [INTRO] section of the voiceover script

2. SYSTEM OVERVIEW (30-40 seconds)
   - Show a diagram or flowchart of the system architecture
   - Alternatively, show the neural network visualization from demo_window.py
   - Read the [SYSTEM OVERVIEW] section of the voiceover script

3. ANIMATION DEMONSTRATION (60-90 seconds)
   - Run "python animate_roulette.py"
   - Let the animation run from start to finish
   - Narrate what's happening using the [ANIMATION DEMONSTRATION] section of the script
   - Point out key elements as they appear:
     * Initial ball and wheel speeds
     * The moment prediction is made
     * Ball slowing down and moving inward
     * Final outcome matching the prediction

4. NEURAL NETWORK EXPLANATION (30-40 seconds)
   - Run "python demo_window.py" and focus on the neural network visualization
   - Alternatively, show plots/neural_network_visualization.png
   - Read the [NEURAL NETWORK EXPLANATION] section of the script
   - Point out the different layers and connections in the network

5. TRAINING RESULTS (30-40 seconds)
   - Show the training metrics plot (plots/training_metrics_demo.png)
   - Alternatively, run the demo_minimal.py and skip to the metrics section
   - Read the [TRAINING RESULTS] section of the script
   - Point out the upward trend in accuracy and reward

6. CONCLUSION (15-20 seconds)
   - Return to a simple slide or the main animation
   - Read the [CONCLUSION] section of the script

TOTAL VIDEO LENGTH: Approximately 3-4 minutes

TIPS FOR RECORDING:
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Pause briefly between sections
- Consider recording the screen and audio separately if easier
- If you make a mistake, pause, take a breath, and start the section again
- You can edit out mistakes later
- Test your recording setup before doing the full recording
- Make sure the animations and visualizations are clearly visible

EDITING TIPS:
- Trim any long pauses or mistakes
- Add simple transitions between sections if desired
- Consider adding soft background music (optional)
- Ensure audio levels are consistent throughout
- Add captions or subtitles if presenting to a diverse audience
